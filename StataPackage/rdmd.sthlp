{marker description}{...}
{title:Description}

{p 4 8}{cmd:rdmd} utilizes causal identification procedures developd in Abdulkadiroglu, Angrist, Narita, and Pathak (2017, 2022) to determine the causal effects of school attendance on applicant outcomes. {cmd:rdmd} takes into account situations where certain schools employ randomly assigned lottery tie-breakers, while others use non-lottery tie-breakers such as test scores. Also, {cmd:rdmd} incorporates the cases where schools provide an advantage to specific groups of applicants by multiplying their tie-breaker values by a certain amount. {p_end}

{synopt :{cmd:bwtype}(string)}Bandwidth type. User can select "IK" or "CCFT". Default is "IK".{p_end}
{synopt :{cmd:bwcriterion}(integer)}Bandwidth population criterion. Select a positive integer. Default is 5.{p_end}
{synoptline}

{dlgtab:Bandwidth Type}

{p 4 8}{cmd:IK} Bandwidths estimation suggested by Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012). This method minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) of the local linear regression estimator, taking into account both the bias and the variance. The bandwidths used here are computed as described by Armstrong and Koles√°r (2018) and in the {browse "https://github.com/tbarmstr/RDHonest-vStata/":rdhonest} package.{p_end}

{p 4 8}{cmd:CCFT} Bandwidths estimation suggested by Calonico et al. (2017). This method calculates local quadratic estimator with regularized bandwidth selector and bias-correction. The bandwidths used here are computed as in the {browse "https://github.com/rdpackages/rdrobust/":rdrobust} package{p_end}

{p 4 8} Each method has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, which vary depending on the specific context. For instance, {cmd:IK} bandwidths can be sensitive to outliers and extreme values, and they do not consider heteroskedasticity or non-normality of the errors. {cmd:CCFT} method is generally more computationally intensive and complex, and it tends to perform better with larger sample sizes. It is important for users to carefully consider the characteristics of their data and select the appropriate bandwidth type accordingly.

{dlgtab:Bandwidth Population Criterion}

{p 4 8}After user selects the bandwidth type, user may choose the bandwidth population criterion. For example, if user chooses 5 as the criterion, the bandwidth for non-lottery programs is set to zero when there are fewer than five in-bandwidth observations on one or the other side of the relevant cutoff. User should choose one integer. Default is 5.{p_end}

{p 4 8} There is trade-off between the precision of the estimation and sample size. Choice of bandwidth population criterion depends on various factors such as the shape and distribution of the running variable, the functional form and smoothness of the regression function, precision of the estimated treatment effect, and the number of covariates included in the model. User is recommended to compare result for different criteria and check the sensitivity and robustness of the bandwidths.

{dlgtab:Balance}

{p 4 8}Balance regression results.{p_end}
{p 4 8}
The values in the table represents the regression coefficients of each covariate on the dummy variable indicating assignment to treated schools. The Left half of the table shows the results of the balance regression without including local propensity score control or local piecewise linear control for screened tie-breakers. The right half of the table shows the results of the balance regression including local propensity score control and local piecewise linear control for screened tie-breakers. For instance, if there are two types of treatment in the data, the first two columns represent uncontrolled balance regressions, while the last two columns represent controlled balance regressions.
