{title:Description}

{p 4 8}{cmd:rdmd} utilizes identification procedures developd in Abdulkadiroglu, Angrist, Narita, and Pathak (2017, 2022) to determine the causal effects of school attendance on student outcomes. {cmd:rdmd} takes into account situations where certain schools employ randomly assigned lottery tie-breakers, while others use non-lottery tie-breakers such as test scores. Also, {cmd:rdmd} incorporates the cases where schools provide an advantage to specific groups of students by multiplying their tie-breaker values by a certain amount. {p_end}

{dlgtab:Bandwidth Type}

{p 4 8}{cmd:IK} Bandwidths estimation suggested by Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012). This method minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) of the local linear regression estimator, taking into account both the bias and the variance. The bandwidths used here are computed as described by Armstrong and Koles√°r (2018) and in the
RDhonest package.{p_end}

{p 4 8}{cmd:CCFT} Bandwidths estimation suggested by Calonico et al. (2017). This method calculates local quadratic estimator with regularized bandwidth selector and bias-correction.{p_end}

{p 4 8} Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the context. IK bandwidths can be sensitive to outliers and extreme values and does not account for heteroskedasticity or non-normality of the errors. The CCFT method is genrally computationally cmore intensive and complex, requiring a large sample size to perform well. User should consider characteristic of data and select the appropriate bandwidth type.

{dlgtab:Bandwidth Population Criterion}

{p 4 8} There is trade-off between the precision of the estimation and sample size. Choice of bandwidth population criterion depends on various factors such as the shape and distribution of the running variable, the functional form and smoothness of the regression function, precision of the estimated treatment effect, and the number of covariates included in the model. User should compare result for different criteria and check the sensitivity and robustness of your bandwidths.

{title:Output Tables}

{dlgtab:Balance}

{p 4 8}Balance regression results.{p_end}
{p 4 8}
The values in the table represents the regression coefficients of each covariate on the dummy variable indicating assignment to treated schools.
The Left half of the table shows the results of the balance regression without including local propensity score control or local piecewise linear control for screened tie-breakers. The right half of the table shows the results of the balance regression including local propensity score control and local piecewise linear control for screened tie-breakers. For instance, if there are two types of treatment in the data, the first two columns represent uncontrolled balance regressions, while the last two columns represent controlled balance regressions.
